# Data_Analytics_Projects:

This repository contains differents project that I worked on under Udacity Data Analysis-Nanaodegree.

Udacity data analyst nano-degree program trained me on how to gather data from different sources according to business requirements, clean and organize data, draw out paaterns, insights, meaningful conclusions and clearly communicate critical findings. I developed proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL at the end of these projects.

## Project 1: Explore Weather Trends with weather forecast data.
I performed a data analysis process on the weather forecast datasets. I asked different questions about the data, and I analysed the data to provide answers.

## Project 2: Investigate a dataset called TMDb movie data.
I used statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and reported my conclusions and recommendations in a report.

## Project 3: Analyze A/B Test Results with company ab_data.csv
I gathered data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it using python. The wrangling process was documented in a jupyter notebook including analyses and visualizations using python and SQL.By using AB Testing and regression methods to decide if the company should launch a new webpage or keep the old one.

## Project 4 : Data Wrangle and Analyze with Tweet WeRateDogs data
I gathered data from different sources, assessed the data visually and programmatically, cleaned the data for visualization and found differnt insights.

## Project 5: Data Visulization with Diamond Data
Data visualization to a dataset involving the characteristics of diamonds and their prices.

## Project 6: Communicate data finding with Ford Go Bike Sharing Data
In this project, I used Pythonâ€™s data visualization tools to systematically explore the bike dataset for its properties and relationships between variables. Then, I created a presentation that communicates the findings to others.
